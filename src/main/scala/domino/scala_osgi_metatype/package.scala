/**
 * Contains Scala interfaces, adapters and builders for easily building OSGi Metatype descriptions.
 * OSGi Metatype descriptions are very well suited for quickly providing administration user interfaces.
 *
 * You probably want to check out the [[builders]].
 *
 * @note I created totally new Scala interfaces and adapters instead of directly implementing the Java interfaces
 *       of the OSGi Metatype API in order to prevent name clashes and confusion about what method to call. Scala Swing
 *       does it the same way, I guess for the same reasons.
